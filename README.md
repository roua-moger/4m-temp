# Launching Sketches

A simple technique to connect images into an interactive click dummy and deploy them on a website.

This can be your starting point for an iterative development process, where you replace images with functional code step by step.

Based on React + React Router and easily deployed to Vercel.

# Debug View

If you want to see the interactive areas while positioning them in the click dummy, open up App.js and change the debug variable to `true`.

`const debug = true;`
